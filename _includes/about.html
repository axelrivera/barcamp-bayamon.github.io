                      BarCamp is an ad-hoc unconference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment.<br/>
                      It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from attendees.<br/>
                      All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. <br/>
                      Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall.<br/>
                      The people present at the event will select the demos or presentations they want to see.
